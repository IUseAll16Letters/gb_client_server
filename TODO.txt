Major:
    1. Rewrite SQL requests to ORM style, instead of raw;
    2. Make superuser mechanics;
    3. DRY rewrite code of main functions;
    4. Re-make authorization mechanism from dict based to session or cookie based;
Minor:
    1. Verify username at /register:
        a. remove spaces or replace them with underscores;
        b. use regexp to scan username.
    2. Rewrite code to OOP patterns;
    3. Optimize client handler logics, too askew;
