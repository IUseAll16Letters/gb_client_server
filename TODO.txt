Major:
    1. Rewrite SQL requests to ORM style, instead of raw;
    2. Make superuser mechanics;

    4. Remake authorization mechanism from dict based to session or cookie based;
Minor:
    1. Username at register verification, remove spaces or replace them with underscores;
    2. Rewrite code to OOP patterns;
    3. Optimize client handler logics, too askew;
